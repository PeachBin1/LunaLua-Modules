# LunaLua-Modules

A collection of modules I've made for SMBX + LunaLua.

# What is LunaLua?
LunaLua is a godsend: created by Kevsoft, it is an extension to the original LunaDLL. Using LunaLua, you can not only execute LunaDLL's autocode scripts, but also you can create your own Lua scripts!

[LunaLua Reference]!(http://engine.wohlnet.ru/wiki/index.php?title=Category:LunaLua_API)

## API Scripts (folder: api_scripts)

The API scripts should be placed in your SMBX/LuaScriptsLib folder. Be sure to retain the file name so that any episodes that reference these will not throw errors. 

## Level Scripts (folder: level_scripts)

These should be placed in your level folder, named as `lunadll.lua`.

## All Level Scripts (folder: world_scripts)

These should be placed in the episode's root directory (with .lvl files and saves). This must be named `lunaworld.lua`.

## World Map Scripts (folder: overworld_scripts)

These should be placed in the episode's root directory (with .lvl files and saves). This must be named `lunaoverworld.lua`.
